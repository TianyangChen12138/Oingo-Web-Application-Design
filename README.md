# Oingo-Web-Application-Design

You are hired by a startup company to help build the database backend for a new mobile app named oingo that allows users
to share useful information via their mobile devices based on social, geographic, temporal, and keyword constraints. Of
course, oingo borrows ideas from many existing applications such as Foursquare, Twitter, Facebook, etc. The main idea
in oingo is that users can publish information in the form of short notes, and then link these notes to certain locations and
certain times. Other users can then receive these notes based on their own location, the current time, and based on what
type of messages they want to receive. The startup believes that this may become a popular application as it can be useful
in many scenarios. 

In the backend, you will have to design the relational database that stores all the
information about users, friendships between users, notes published by users, and filters that users have for what kind of
notes they want to receive at different times and in different situations (i.e., states and locations). In the frontend, you have to design a web-accessible interface for this system
